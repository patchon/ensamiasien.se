    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate my birthday last week me and Gen decided (in last minute) to get
ourselves to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WHWhTyUWMyr">Anilao</a>. A popular macro diving
site located only &ldquo;three hours&rdquo; away from Manila. Three hours Filipino time that
is. You probably can make it in three hours if you decide to go with a private
transport, however if you go with the local transport including a bus ride,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney">jeepney ride</a> and finally a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw_(Philippines)">tricycle ride</a>,
you&rsquo;re probably looking at 5 hours minimum.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are several bus companies that does daily routes down to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dHCT6HNuhUR2">Batangas City</a>, we chose the one called
<a href="http://www.jam.com.ph/">Jam Liner</a> and paid roughly 125 php per person. When
you arrive at the bus station in
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dHCT6HNuhUR2">Batangas City</a> you simply switch to one of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney">jeepneys</a> going to Mabini
(another 35 php per person). Be sure to tell the driver that you are going to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WHWhTyUWMyr">Anilao</a> so he can drop you off at the
&ldquo;the crossing&rdquo; where you would continue the last part with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw_(Philippines)">tricycle</a> for about
120 php.</p>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;m fully capable of carrying my own bag, this little kid insisted
on helping me carry my bag from the bus to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney">jeepney</a>. It was only about fifty meters
and I told him several times that I would carry my own bag. Around half way he
gave up, and I continued to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney">jeepney</a>.
Later when I was joking around with the jeepney-drivers the kid snuck up on me
and lifted my bag into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney">jeepney</a>.
I laughed for my self and gave the boy some money. I would have loved to give
him credit for his quick-witted mind but he disappeared. I like to think that
this boy is going places if anybody just gave him the chance. Unfortunately the
world is tough and far from everyone gets the chance they deserve.</p>

<p>We arrived quite late to this resort called
<a href="http://goo.gl/rA4TyR">Halo Anilao Dive Resort</a> located far from the busy streets
life of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WHWhTyUWMyr">Anilao</a>. The resort itself isn&rsquo;t
anything special, I mean the rooms were nice and the food was good, but the
place it self was kind of &ldquo;meh&rdquo;. It kinda threw me off a bit, and we only stayed
there one night. The next day we decided to go all in and chose a place called
<a href="http://goo.gl/go2q74">La Chevrerie Resort &amp; Spa</a> (after all, my sister told me
to &ldquo;spoil myself&rdquo; since I&rsquo;m always so stingy, I however consider myself as an
economic person, I&rsquo;ll leave it up for discussion though).</p>

<p><a href="http://goo.gl/go2q74">La Chevrerie Resort &amp; Spa</a> is a fantastic resort in every
aspect, the rooms were amazing, the food was gorgeous, the view was stunning and
the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The only thing I could say
something about is the price, but I guess you get what you pay for. And there
are far more expensive resorts out there, but yes,
<a href="http://goo.gl/go2q74">La Chevrerie Resort &amp; Spa</a> did leave some sort of whole
in my wallet ;)</p>

<p>The plan was to stay in the area for a couple of days, but we cancelled the
holiday since Gen&rsquo;s cat unfortunately passed away. Her name was
<strong>Ate Guy</strong> (pronounced &ldquo;ah-teh-guy&rdquo;) and we brought her to the veterinarian two
days earlier since she hadn&rsquo;t been eating for a while and was very weak. The
veterinarian did what they could and gave her antibiotics, but after two days
<strong>Ate Guy</strong> sadly passed away. Gen rescued <strong>Ate Guy</strong> from the streets about
seven years ago, during these years <strong>Ate Guy</strong> has had the best possible life.
I&rsquo;m sure <strong>Ate Guy</strong> has her place in cat heaven by now.</p>

<center>
<h1 style="color:red;font-weight:bold;font-size:60px;margin-bottom:1px;">❤</h1>
I'm glad I got to meet <strong>Ate Guy</strong> just in time. Such a sweet cat.
<br>
Here she is cuddling with me right before our trip.<br><br>

    <link href="http://www.ensamiasien.se//blog/2015/11/02/apo-reef-simply-stunning/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-02T03:34:30+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.ensamiasien.se//blog/2015/11/02/apo-reef-simply-stunning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time I went to the Philippines I really wanted to go to the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apo_Reef">Apo Reef</a>, but my stinginess actually
kept me from going there. This time though I was really determined to get my
ass over there. It&rsquo;s a little bit tricky to get to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apo_Reef">Apo Reef</a>, but trust me, it&rsquo;s
definitely worth the effort.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now, the tricky part is actually to find a way to get to the reef itself. Since
it&rsquo;s located south-east of the island
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindoro">Mindoro</a> not to many dive shops operate
the reef, nor is there a quick easy way to get to any of the shops that do.
You basically have two options, either you go with a dive shop in Coron, or you
go by one located on Mindoro. I definitely recommend
<a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> located about one hour
south of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7SqZ94urZDF2">Sablayan</a> on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindoro">Mindoro</a>.
<a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> is a professional
dive shop run by Micheal Roos and has been doing trips to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apo_Reef">Apo Reef</a> for about eight years now.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get to <a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> is to
take a flight from Manila to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a> and
then ask <a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> for a pickup in
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a>. The flight from Manila departs
roughly three times a week, so be sure to make your
booking in time. However, if you feel a little bit more adventures you can take
the one of the buses from Manila down to Batangas and from there try to find
your own way over to Mindoro and down to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a>. Or, you could take the famous
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dimple-Star-Transport-10150148192685221/">Dimplestar Bus</a>
which will take you all the way. I chose the latter and went with the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dimple-Star-Transport-10150148192685221/">Dimplestar</a>
all the way from Manila to <a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> (the
bus line is actually going all the way to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a>, but
<a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> is located north of
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a>, so
you&rsquo;ll have to get off in a small &ldquo;town&rdquo; called Concepcion, where
<a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> will pick you up). <strong>Note</strong>, you&rsquo;ll
also have to tell
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dimple-Star-Transport-10150148192685221/">Dimplestar</a>
that you are going either to <a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a> or to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7SqZ94urZDF2">Sablayan</a>. It&rsquo;s probably safer to say
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7SqZ94urZDF2">Sablayan</a>, because they might not know
<a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a>. The reason you have to mention
this is because there is two ways to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a>,
one is passing <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7SqZ94urZDF2">Sablayan</a> and
<a href="http://www.aporeefclub.com/">Apo Reef Club</a>, the other one is not (it&rsquo;s taking
the east route of Mindoro, and you don&rsquo;t want to get stuck in
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a>).</p>

<p>With that being said, prepare yourself for a 13 hour long bus ride, including
several hundred stops, a delayed and very slow ferry, the bumpiest road you&rsquo;ll
ever experience and some extremely loud fucking techno music. If thats what you
fancy and you&rsquo;ve only got 800 php to spend on the ride, this is the way to go.
Otherwise, just take the god damn flight to
 <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/TNo6gVdZofM2">San Jose</a> - I&rsquo;m for sure not doing
that nightmare bus ride ever again. And yes, there is some sort of schedule with
these buses, but as everything else in the Philippines it may vary from day to
day so you better call them and ask first. Oh, the phone numbers doesn&rsquo;t really
work either so you better get your ass to the bus station and ask the guy behind
the counter; welcome to the Philippines ;)</p>

<p>Enough ranting on how to get there, here&rsquo;s the goodies about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apo_Reef">Apo Reef</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apo_Reef">Apo Reef</a> is the world&rsquo;s second-largest
contiguous coral reef system and the largest in the Philippines. It houses 385
species of colorful marine fishes including families of sharks (including
hammerheads if it&rsquo;s the right season), stingrays,
mantas (seasonal), school of jacks, snappers, barracudas, mackerels,
and green humphead parrotfish, swarms of tropical aquarium fish, blennies
and gobies. The visibility is above anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen before.
I did eleven dives at the reef and we had 40m+ visibility on every dive
(if you aren&rsquo;t a diver, you can literally just snorkel - visibility is that
good). The thing that really blew me away (except the stuff mentioned above) was
that the reef wasn&rsquo;t crowded with divers, not a single one actually, it&rsquo;s only
you, your buddies and the fishes - it&rsquo;s extremely cool.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from me describing it on facebook,
&ldquo;<em>Imagine a pool (you know, where you have a visibility of 40m+).</em>
<em>And then you add every freaking colorful fish you can think of.</em>
<em>And then throw in some sharks, some mackerel, some humpheads, some barracudas,</em>
<em>and yeah throw in some turtles while you&rsquo;re at it. Of course don&rsquo;t forget about</em>
<em>the incredible beautiful scenery (big walls etc).</em>
<em>Then you multiply that imagination by a hundred and maybe, only maybe, you come</em>
<em>close to apo reef.</em>
<em>So, yes, even if the thirteen hour ride here was one of the worst ever,</em>
<em>it was worth it.</em>
<strong>That school of humpheads is just the craziest shit I ever seen.</strong>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apo Reef is simply stunning and definitely one of my favourite dive sites.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Malapascua is the name of an island north of Cebu in the Central Visayas region
in the Philippines. It&rsquo;s a quite small island mostly known for its diving and
the &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; of seeing the famous thresher sharks. Malapascua is definitely
worth a visit and it&rsquo;s actually <strong>not</strong> that tricky to get there, its just like
everything else in the Philippines; <strong>you&rsquo;ve got to have patiense and a lot of
time</strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Easiest way to get in is to take a flight (depending on where you comning from
that is) to Cebu city and then arrange for a private ride (van/taxi) to a city
called Maya. This is of course the most expensive option, the private ride will
probably set you back around 1800 - 2500 php depending on your bargaining skills
, but with that being said, it&rsquo;s also definitely the fastest option. The cheaper
alternative is to go to the &ldquo;north bus station&rdquo; in Cebu city and take the local
bus that leaves about four times per day. That ride will only cost you around
160 php, but could be quite long (mine took almost six hours) so be sure to
bring entertainment.</p>

<p>No matter which alternative you choose, you will end up at the port in Maya
city. From there it&rsquo;s only a short boat ride (about 20 minutes) until you reach
Malapascua island. Transfer boats leave regularly (between 6am - 6pm) and cost
80 php. If the tide is low, you will have to pay for a small &ldquo;transfer boat&rdquo;
which will cost you 20 php (this is 20 php on the Maya side, and another 20 php
at the Malapascua side). They will try to make you pay a lot more, but just ask
the locals how much they pay and tell the boat man that you want the same price
as them.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re finally on the actual island you will have tons of resorts, dive
centers and cheap bungalow accommodations. I went for a private bungalow, right
on the beach next to my diving center for only 700 php per night. My stay was
during the &ldquo;low season&rdquo; though so be prepared to pay up to 1200 for these
bungalows (the place I stayed at was called &ldquo;Dannio&rsquo;s&rdquo; or something similar, I
had hard time with that name). As for the diving I went with a place called
Evolution, a very professional shop located at the end of the beach. There are
tons of options so I recommend just walking around and grab the one you&rsquo;re most
comfortable with. If you do two dives in one day that will cost you somewhere
around 2600 php and upwards, depending on your choosing.</p>

<p>I had a great stay at Evolution and made a lot of new friends. Evolution really
takes care of you and makes you feel at home. They are running a very
professional dive shop, with good dive masters, good equipment and good
briefings, everything is simply top notch. Diving with the thresher sharks is
simply stunning and definitely the main attraction, however make sure not to
miss all the macro stuff.</p>

<p>Mustafa, Seden, Carlo and Freedom, you will always have room in my hostel heart.
Until next time, Mustafa and Carlo, make sure to take good care of your better
halves ;)</p>
