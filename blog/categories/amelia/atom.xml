    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I arrived late afternoon on the tenth of July to Perhentian Islands I was
<strong>terrified</strong>, seriously, <strong>absolutely terrified</strong>. I had planned to go diving
with <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g304004-d2324381-Reviews-Angel_Divers-Pulau_Perhentian_Kecil_Terengganu.html">Angel Divers</a>
since a friend of a friend knew the owner. I arrived at the diveshop and was
greeted by Rob (who&rsquo;s currently a divemaster there) who asked me if I was up for
some diving.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I nervously said that I was and that all I basically wanted to do on the Island
was to dive. We decided to go diving in the morning and I went on looking for
some accommodation. At the end of the beach there was an interesting place
called the <strong>butterfly guesthouse</strong> where you &ldquo;signed your self in&rdquo;. If there
was a key on the board, the room was free, and you could take it. No reception,
no one to talk to or anything, just a key (if you were lucky, which I actually
was, you could run into the guy running the place and he would show you your
chalet). The condition of the chalets were pretty poor and unfortunately there
was some animals (like bats and rats) hanging around. Even though these chalets
provide the best view on the whole Island I only stayed there for a night. I
guess I&rsquo;m a little bit to comfortable for that kind of living. It&rsquo;s a shame
though that the place is falling a part since it&rsquo;s so freaking cool. Later on
I ended up staying directly on the beach in one of
<strong>Mayas Guest House&rsquo;s</strong> bungalows, which fitted me perfectly.</p>

<p>I did all my diving at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g304004-d2324381-Reviews-Angel_Divers-Pulau_Perhentian_Kecil_Terengganu.html">Angel Divers</a>
and I met some really good friends. The first two weeks we were about ten people
that got to know each other really well. This was an amazing experience for me,
I still can&rsquo;t believe how that many people ended up in the same place and
everyone just got along. The weeks went by and people started to leave
for new adventures. I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about when to leave but I knew I was
going to Borneo for some jungle tracking and a lot more diving. Luckily enough
two German girls came by the shop to do some diving before they would hit
Borneo. I nervously asked them if I could tag a long for a while since its much
funnier to travel with people. They were more than happy to let me tag a long,
and for that I&rsquo;m eternally grateful. Luisa and Isabel are two amazing people and
I&rsquo;ve had so much fun with them (and will for another week or two). They are
seriously the kindest friends, and even though I felt a little bit sad about
leaving Perhentian, I couldn&rsquo;t have gotten a better start on my Borneo
adventure &lt;3</p>

<p>Thanks again <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g304004-d2324381-Reviews-Angel_Divers-Pulau_Perhentian_Kecil_Terengganu.html">Angel Divers</a>
