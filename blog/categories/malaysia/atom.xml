    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning we arrived at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching">Kuching</a>, the
capital of Sarawak. We had to get up at 4am so we were pretty torn out when we
arrived. We fought the tiredness though and decided to get to know the city a
little better with a walk. It didn&rsquo;t take long before we fell in love
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching">Kuching</a> and it&rsquo;s beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarawak_River">Sarawak river</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarawak_River">Sarawak River</a> is amazingly cool and runs through the whole city acting as an
important transport area. We decided to take one of the tour boats (for 20
ringit) which goes both ways on the river for an hour. The tour boat isn&rsquo;t
really &ldquo;guided&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s only provided by a driver whom didn&rsquo;t seem to
show any interest at all in pointing out stuff for us. Luckily we met a guy
called Chris and his wife Charlie who knew the city really well. Turns out that
they go to Malaysia twice a year, and that Chris is an old war veteran and was
invited by the Malaysian Government this year to celebrate that 50 years had
gone by since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia_confrontation">conflict between Malaysia and Indonesia</a>
ended. Pretty interesting fella who definitely liked to talk (picture with him
below).</p>

<p>We ended the day at the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.se/Restaurant_Review-g298309-d4114959-Reviews-Black_Bean-Kuching_Sarawak.html">Black Bean</a>
who happened to serve the best coffee in town. Small, cozy coffee shop with all
sorts of coffee and a very friendly staff. If you are up to it, why not enjoy
the coffee with some sort of &ldquo;local fishcake&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s suppose to be really good,
I however, was not up for it. My friends seemed to like it though.</p>

<p>Lastly, we got totally lost when headed back to <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.se/Hotel_Review-g298309-d1976625-Reviews-Beds_Guesthouse-Kuching_Sarawak.html">Beds Guest House</a>
and ended up walking for an hour instead of the &ldquo;normal 10 minute walk&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.se/Hotel_Review-g298309-d1976625-Reviews-Beds_Guesthouse-Kuching_Sarawak.html">Beds Guest House</a>
is btw an insanely good guest house with extremely (I mean hotel style) clean
rooms and a very friendly staff that will help you with whatever you need.
Price is good and we ended up paying 25 ringit each / per night for our own room
on the loft. Right outside the guest house you will meet <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.se/Restaurant_Review-g298309-d3162752-Reviews-Annie_Kolo_mee-Kuching_Sarawak.html">Annie</a>
who probably makes one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching">Kuching&rsquo;s</a> best
<a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/food/article/kolo-mee-a-sarawak-favourite-any-time-of-day">Kolo mee</a>,
winning!</p>

    <updated>2015-07-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.ensamiasien.se//blog/2015/07/25/diving-at-perhentian</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I arrived late afternoon on the tenth of July to Perhentian Islands I was
<strong>terrified</strong>, seriously, <strong>absolutely terrified</strong>. I had planned to go diving
with <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g304004-d2324381-Reviews-Angel_Divers-Pulau_Perhentian_Kecil_Terengganu.html">Angel Divers</a>
since a friend of a friend knew the owner. I arrived at the diveshop and was
greeted by Rob (who&rsquo;s currently a divemaster there) who asked me if I was up for
some diving.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I nervously said that I was and that all I basically wanted to do on the Island
was to dive. We decided to go diving in the morning and I went on looking for
some accommodation. At the end of the beach there was an interesting place
called the <strong>butterfly guesthouse</strong> where you &ldquo;signed your self in&rdquo;. If there
was a key on the board, the room was free, and you could take it. No reception,
no one to talk to or anything, just a key (if you were lucky, which I actually
was, you could run into the guy running the place and he would show you your
chalet). The condition of the chalets were pretty poor and unfortunately there
was some animals (like bats and rats) hanging around. Even though these chalets
provide the best view on the whole Island I only stayed there for a night. I
guess I&rsquo;m a little bit to comfortable for that kind of living. It&rsquo;s a shame
though that the place is falling a part since it&rsquo;s so freaking cool. Later on
I ended up staying directly on the beach in one of
<strong>Mayas Guest House&rsquo;s</strong> bungalows, which fitted me perfectly.</p>

<p>I did all my diving at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g304004-d2324381-Reviews-Angel_Divers-Pulau_Perhentian_Kecil_Terengganu.html">Angel Divers</a>
and I met some really good friends. The first two weeks we were about ten people
that got to know each other really well. This was an amazing experience for me,
I still can&rsquo;t believe how that many people ended up in the same place and
everyone just got along. The weeks went by and people started to leave
for new adventures. I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about when to leave but I knew I was
going to Borneo for some jungle tracking and a lot more diving. Luckily enough
two German girls came by the shop to do some diving before they would hit
Borneo. I nervously asked them if I could tag a long for a while since its much
funnier to travel with people. They were more than happy to let me tag a long,
and for that I&rsquo;m eternally grateful. Louis and Isabel are two amazing people and
I&rsquo;ve had so much fun with them (and will for another week or two). They are
seriously the kindest friends, and even though I felt a little bit sad about
leaving Perhentian, I couldn&rsquo;t have gotten a better start on my Borneo
adventure &lt;3</p>

<p>Thanks again <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g304004-d2324381-Reviews-Angel_Divers-Pulau_Perhentian_Kecil_Terengganu.html">Angel Divers</a>
, see you soon again.</p>
